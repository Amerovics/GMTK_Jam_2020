### Build your way with your own controls.
<p>With your 3 controls (Left, Right, Jump) available at the bottom of the screen, you can <strong>drag them in the world to use them as platforms</strong>. But don't use too many, or you could run out of controls !</p>
<p>Because as soon as one is placed, you <strong>can't use it for movement</strong>. It will be locked until you retrieve the control from the world.<br></p>

### Controls

The game plays with a mouse and keyboard.

<ul>
    <li><strong>Move:</strong> Left and Right arrow / A and D</li>
    <li><strong>Jump:</strong> Up arrow / Space</li>

</ul>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pause / Quit:</strong> Escape</li>
